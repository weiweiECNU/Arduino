## Announcement

This group is develop a SleepBud using arduino board coding program. Basically as this project could seperate the work to web design and coding arduino, we simply separated our team member into three small groups. One person is a project manage and two groupmates need to design a web page for collecting real-time data and the rest of two people are coding on arduino.

## Descriptio

SleepBud is a software to monitering people's sleep and give the advice or simple comments on their sleep quality. Sleep issue may cause many desease. Thus we want to make a software to let people know how they are sleeping during the night and what they should do if they have bad sleep.

## Technology

* Arduino
* Python
* Django

## How to Run a Test

Notes: The real-time data is collected so that the test data may change frequently. 

0. Make sure Python and Django has initalled and could run properly in your laptop
1. Open a terminal(for Unix or Linux) or a Command Window(for Windows)
2. Change directory into ./SleepBud

## How to Run the Project Locally?

0. Make sure Python and Django has initalled and could run properly in your laptop
1. Open a terminal(for Unix or Linux) or a Command Window(for Windows)
2. Change directory into ./SleepBud
3. If you have any issue, please contact to our engineers.
